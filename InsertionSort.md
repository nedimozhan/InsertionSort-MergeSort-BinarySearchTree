# [22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort

## Insertion Sort Algorithm Steps :

    First Step -> [2,27,16,22,18,6]
    Second Step -> [2,6,16,22,18,27]
    Third Step -> [2,6,16,22,18,27]
    Fourth Step -> [2,6,16,18,22,27]
    Fiveth Step -> [2,6,16,18,22,27]
    Last Step -> [2,6,16,18,22,27]
## Insertion Sort Algorithm Big-O Notation :
    -> n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1 
    -> (n * (n+1)) / 2
    -> O(N^2)
## Case of The Number 18 :
    When we sort the array, the number(18) is in the middle of the array. So we can say that the number(18) is average case.

## [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] -> First Four Steps With Insertion Sort Algorithm :
    First Step -> [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]
    Second Step -> [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6] (has nothing change)
    Third Step -> [2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6]
    Fourth Step -> [2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6]
